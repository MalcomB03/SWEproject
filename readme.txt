Compilation: Place all the above files in the same directory and compile with javac *.java.

Running the Application: Run the application using java FlightPlanningApp. The splash screen appears first. Once you click “Continue” you will be in the flight planning GUI where you can enter airport queries, load available airplanes, and compute a flight plan.

Extensions: This basic example satisfies your functional and non-functional requirements. 
You can extend it by:

    Adding dialogs for CRUD operations on airports and airplanes.

    Persisting the data to a file or database.

    Enhancing the GUI (e.g., providing a graphical map for the flight plan).
